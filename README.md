# Quote Generate
Built using React.js and Redux

## Description

I built this quote generator app to help me deepen my understanding of React.js and to practice using React with Redux. The HTML is very minimal as my React/Redux code, housed in the .js file, does all the heavy lifting of rendering HTML from JSX. A variety of functions are built into the React/Redux code to determine the logic of the app and manage state changes. Using Redux ensures one-directional data flow.

## Getting Started

You can find my original files in /src/app, and the root files are copied over from /src/build. I commented fairly extensively throughout the files, but please let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub Pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/Quote_Generator/). Thanks for dropping by!

### Depencies

* React
* ReactDOM
* Redux
* React-Redux
* Babel
* Webpack

(The last two are used to convert the JSX and ES6 from the React/Redux code.)
